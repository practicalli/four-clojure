# four-clojure

Discussions of various solutions to the [4Ever Clojure challenges](https://4clojure.oxal.org/) 

> 4Ever Clojure replaces the decommissioned 4clojure.com website and includes the same challenges.

Rather than just sharing the solutions, or showing off how small a golf score can be attained (there lays madness), these solutions cover various different solutions and offers opinions as to those solutions in terms of readability, abstraction where relevant performance.

[Practicalli 4 Clojure Walk-though video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiDB_KGrbliCsCUrmcBvdW16) contains Live coding sessions of some of the 4Clojure challenges.

## Usage

Open a file in your favourite Clojure editor and evaluate the code in the REPL.
