# four-clojure

Clojure design journal source code from solving [4Ever Clojure challenges](https://4clojure.oxal.org/).

> 4Ever Clojure replaces the decommissioned 4clojure.com website and includes the same challenges.

Rather than just sharing the solutions, or showing off how small a golf score can be attained (there lays madness), these design journals show the working to get to one or more solutions

Each design journal offers opinions as to those solutions in terms of idioms, readability, abstraction and where relevant performance.

[Practicalli 4 Clojure Walk-though video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiDB_KGrbliCsCUrmcBvdW16) contains Live coding sessions of some of the 4Clojure challenges.

## Usage

Open a file in your favourite Clojure editor and evaluate the code in the REPL.
