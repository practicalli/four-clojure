;; #054 Partition a Sequence
;;

;; Difficulty:	Medium
;; Topics:	seqs core-functions
;; Special Restrictions: partition partition-all

;; Write a function which returns a sequence of lists of x items each. Lists of less than x items should not be returned.

;; (= (__ 3 (range 9)) '((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8)))
;; (= (__ 2 (range 8)) '((0 1) (2 3) (4 5) (6 7)))
;; (= (__ 3 (range 8)) '((0 1 2) (3 4 5)))


;; Deconstruct the problem
;;

;; Write a function that takes a number and sequence as an argument

;; The sequence should be transformed into sub-sequences.  Each sequence should contain the number of items given by the first argument

;; If a sub-sequence does not contain as many items as given by the first argument, then that sequence should not be returned.

;; We will need to return these sub-sequences as a collection.

;; This is the behaviour of the `partition` function in `clojure.core`

(partition 3 (range 9))


;; => ((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8))

(partition 2 (range 8))


;; => ((0 1) (2 3) (4 5) (6 7))

;; When the partition is not evenly divisible by the size of the sequence, partition drops the incomplete sub-sequence
(partition 3 (range 8))


;; => ((0 1 2) (3 4 5))

;; `partition-all` works in the same way, however, it will keep incomplete sub-sequences

(partition-all 3 (range 9))


;; => ((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8))

(partition-all 2 (range 8))


;; => ((0 1) (2 3) (4 5) (6 7))

;; The `(6 7)` sub-sequence is returned this time, even though it does not have 3 items.
(partition-all 3 (range 8))


;; => ((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7))

;; loop recur

;; iterate through the sequence
;; - check to see there are enough elements left
;; - take elements to make a new sub sequence of the right size size
;; - drop the taken elements and pass the remaining back into the loop

;; xs is a common Clojure abbreviation referring to a sequence

(fn [-sub-sequence-size
     xs]
  (loop [-sub-sequences []
         -sequence      xs]

    ;; check to see if we have too few elements left in the sequence
    (if (< (count -sequence) -sub-sequence-size)

      ;; Not enough elements left, return what we have found so far
      -sub-sequences

      ;; Still have a enough elements left in our sequence
      (recur

        ;; Add sub-sequence
        (conj -sub-sequences (take -sub-sequence-size -sequence))

        ;; new value for sequence - iterating by sub-sequence size
        (drop -sub-sequence-size -sequence)))))


;; logic of the `if` expression

(if (< (count (range 9)) 3)
  :stop
  :continue)


(if (< (count (range 1)) 3)
  :stop
  :continue)


;; How the conj in the recur expression works

(conj [] [0 1 2])


(conj (conj [] [0 1 2])
      [3 4 5])


(conj
  (conj (conj [] [0 1 2])
        [3 4 5])
  [6 7 8])


;; => [[0 1 2] [3 4 5] [6 7 8]]


;; lets test the function definition

((fn [-sub-sequence-size
      xs]
   (loop [-sub-sequences []
          -sequence      xs]

     ;; check to see if we have too few elements left in the sequence
     (if (< (count -sequence) -sub-sequence-size)

       ;; Not enough elements left, return what we have found so far
       -sub-sequences

       ;; Still have a enough elements left in our sequence
       (recur

         ;; Add sub-sequence
         (conj -sub-sequences (take -sub-sequence-size -sequence))

         ;; new value for sequence - iterating by sub-sequence size
         (drop -sub-sequence-size -sequence)))))

;; group-by
;;

;; `(group-by f coll)`
;; Returns a map of the elements of coll keyed by the result of
;; f on each element. The value at each key will be a vector of the
;; corresponding elements, in the order they appeared in coll.


(group-by odd? (range 9))


;; => {false [0 2 4 6 8], true [1 3 5 7]}


(group-by identity (range 9))

;; `group-by` is not useful in solving this challenge


;; partition-by - similar issue to group-by

;; take and drop approach

(take 3 (range 9))

;; if we can identify start points for each sub-sequence,
;; then we can take just the number of elements for a sub-sequence
;; then repeat until the end.

|----| |---| |---|


;; The `range` function has an optional argument that is a step size
;; so if our sub-sequences should be size 3 and the sequence is size 9,
;; we can create the following

(range 0 9 1)


;; => (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

(range 0 9 2)

(range 0 9 3)


;; => (0 3 6)

;; This gives the starting point of each of the sub-sequences

;; We are given the step size for each 4Clojure tests



;; List comprehension - `for`
;;

;; `for` is a macro for iterating though a sequence and creating a new structure.

;; A classic example is a combination lock generator.
;; Imagine you have a three tumbler lock with each tumbler having the numbers 0 to 9
;; Using a for function you can generate all the combinations possible

(for [tumbler-1 (range 10)
      tumbler-2 (range 10)
      tumbler-3 (range 10)]
  [tumbler-1 tumbler-2 tumbler-3])
