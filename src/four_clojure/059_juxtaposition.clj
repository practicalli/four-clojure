;; 059 - Juxtaposition
;;

;; Difficulty:	Medium
;; Topics:	higher-order-functions core-functions
;; Restrictions: juxt


;; Take a set of functions and return a new function that takes a variable number of arguments and returns a sequence containing the result of applying each function left-to-right to the argument list.

;; (= [21 6 1] ((__ + max min) 2 3 5 1 6 4))
;; (= ["HELLO" 5] ((__ #(.toUpperCase %) count) "hello"))
;; (= [2 6 4] ((__ :a :c :b) {:a 2, :b 4, :c 6, :d 8 :e 10}))


;; Deconstruct the problem
;;

;; There is a special restrictions on juxt
;; which means that juxt is probably the answer.

(= [21 6 1] ((juxt + max min) 2 3 5 1 6 4))


;; => true

(= ["HELLO" 5] ((juxt #(.toUpperCase %) count) "hello"))


;; => true

(= [2 6 4] ((juxt :a :c :b) {:a 2, :b 4, :c 6, :d 8 :e 10}))


;; => true

;; Looking at the tests, what does juxt do?

;; juxt takes multiple functions as arguments
;; each function is applied to values
;; and the results are returned
;; Each function is applied to the original values
;; The results of each function are not used by the other functions

;; Clojure docs - juxt
;;
;; https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/juxt

;; Takes a set of functions and returns a fn that is the juxtaposition
;; of those fns.

;; The returned fn takes a variable number of args, and
;; returns a vector containing the result of applying each fn to the
;; args (left-to-right).

;; ((juxt a b c) x) => [(a x) (b x) (c x)]


;; juxtaposition - dictionary definition
;;
;; the fact of two things being seen or placed close together with contrasting effect.

;; All tests pass, yay!


;; Refactor the answer
;;

;; The answer feels a bit too hard coded and its limited to three functions.
;; I am sure we can do something more elegant.


;; Rather than hard code numerous similar branches in our code,
;; we can capture all the given functions as a collect (just like we did with values)

(fn [& fs]
  ,,,)


;; What ever we pass to this function becomes a vector of those arguments

((fn [& fs]
   fs)
 + max min)


;; Rather than apply each the function in turn over the collection,
;; we could map the collection of values over the collection of functions

;; For example, with the first test we would need something like this


(map (fn [f] (apply f [2 3 5 1 6 4])) [+ max min])


;; or using the function definition short form syntax

(map #(apply % [2 3 5 1 6 4]) [+ max min])


;; Then wrap this up into an anonymous function that we return to pick up the collection of values

#_(fn [& values]
    (map #(apply % values) [+ max min]))


;; finally wrap that function to be returned in its own function,
;; so we can get the sequence of functions to be applied as arguments

#_(fn [& fns]
    (fn [& values]
      (map #(apply % values) fns)))


;; So our generic answer for all tests would be

(fn juxt-with-multiple-function
  [& fs]

  (fn return-function
    [& xs]
    (map (fn [f] (apply f xs)) fs)))


;; as above but using the short form syntax
(fn [& fs]
  (fn [& xs]
    (map #(apply % xs) fs)))


;; Answers summary

  (fn [& xs]
    (map #(apply % xs) fs)))
