;; #053 Longest increasing sub-sequence
;;

;; Difficulty:	Hard
;; Topics:	seqs

;; Given a vector of integers, find the longest consecutive sub-sequence of increasing numbers. If two sub-sequences have the same length, use the one that occurs first. An increasing sub-sequence must have a length of 2 or greater to qualify.

;; (= (__ [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5]) [0 1 2 3])
;; (= (__ [5 6 1 3 2 7]) [5 6])
;; (= (__ [2 3 3 4 5]) [3 4 5])
;; (= (__ [7 6 5 4]) [])


;; Deconstruct the problem
;;

;; This challenge took quite a bit of thinking about as its quite an
;; imperative problem, which can easily lead to an imperative solution.

;; Initial reading of the challenge suggests we iterate through the
;; given collection values, keeping a record of each sub sequence as we go.

;; This suggests we need to keep state not just for each sub-sequence
;; but also keeping the value of the previous element as we find consecutive sub-sequences.

;; By transforming the data to more relevantly shaped structures
;; hopefully we can used simpler functions to create the desired results.


;; Basic algorithm:
;; Find the consecutive sub-sequences in a given collection

;; e.g. [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5] would contain [(1) (0 1 2 3) (0) (4 5)]

;; Then find the longest sub-sequence


;; REPL experiments
;;

;; Taking a low abstraction approach with loop and recur

;; Our function takes the collection to be processed as an argument.

;; Solving #53 with partitioning and filters
;;
;; Can we group the numbers together so they are grouped sequentially?

;; Lets partition the first collection
;; Partition into pairs, one step at a time,
;; so each pair of numbers can be compared

(partition 2 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5])


;; => ((1 0) (1 2) (3 0) (4 5))

(partition 2 1 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5])


;; => ((1 0) (0 1) (1 2) (2 3) (3 0) (0 4) (4 5))

;; We have a simple partition of the collection
;; Now we can partition again using a function
;; that compares values, so that we can again group by an increasing sequence

;; We want to see which pair has the second number higher than the first
;; so greater-than function is a simple test.
;; We need to apply the greater-than function to each pair in the partitioned collection
;; As each pair is in a collection then we need to map over each vector of tha tcollection

(map #(apply < %) [[1 0] [0 1] [1 2]])


;; => (false true true)

;; So this gives us a promising looking function to partition with

(partition-by #(apply < %)
              (partition 2 1 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5]))


;; (((1 0))
;; ((0 1) (1 2) (2 3)) ((3 0))
;; ((0 4) (4 5)))

;; we now have a collection that is partitioned where ever
;; the second number of a piair was not greater than the first.

;; We still have one pair that does not increase,
;; so we can filter that out using another function

(filter odd? [1 2 3 4 5])


;; => (1 3 5)


(filter
  (fn [[[number1 number2]]]
    (< number1 number2))
  (partition-by #(apply < %)
                (partition 2 1 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5])))


;; => (((0 1) (1 2) (2 3))
;;     ((0 4) (4 5)))

;; Now we only have two collections of pairs,
;; each of which increases

;; So we can just sort these collections by count,
;; so the biggest collection is first
;; then get the first one.

(sort-by count >
         (filter
           (fn [[[number1 number2]]]
             (< number1 number2))
           (partition-by #(apply < %)
                         (partition 2 1 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5]))))


;; => (((0 1) (1 2) (2 3)) ((0 4) (4 5)))

;; No change in the order of elements returned in this example,
;; but it ensures we have the correct order.
;; So lets get the first element

(first
  (sort-by count >
           (filter
             (fn [[[number1 number2]]]
               (< number1 number2))

                           (partition 2 1 [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5])))))


;; => ((0 1) (1 2) (2 3))


;; So now we just need to combine our remaining collection to get the right shape.

;; We cant just flatten, as we have extra values
(flatten [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])


;; => (0 1 1 2 2 3)


;; If we take the first collection that contains a pair
;; and add the last value from each of the following pairs
;; then we will get the right result

(concat
  (first [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])
  (map last (rest [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])))


;; => (0 1 2 3)


;; It would lead to a lot of repeated code to fit this around the function so far
;; so using the let function will help
